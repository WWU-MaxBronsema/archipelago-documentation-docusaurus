This is where Archipelago differs and starts to propose its own style. You noticed that there is a single Content Type named `Digital Object` and you have here a single Web Form. So how does this allow you to have images, sequences, videos, audio, 3D images, etc?\n\nThere are many ways of answering that, Archipelago works under the idea of an (or many) Open Schema(s), and that notion permeates the whole environment. Practical answer and simplest way to explain based on this demo is:\n\n- The `Digital Object` is a generic container for any shape of metadata. Metadata is generated either via this Webform-based widget you're currently using, manually (power-user need only) or via APIs. Because of this, Metadata can take any shape to express your needs of Digital Objects and therefore we do not recommend making multiple Digital Object types. However, if you ever do need more Digital Object types, the option is available.\n- The Strawberry field Field Widget allows you to attach any `Webform`, built using the [`Webform Module`](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/webform) and Webforms can be setup in almost infinite ways. Any field, combo, or style can be used. Multi Step, single step - we made sure they always only touch/modify data they know how to touch, so even a single input element webform would ensure any previous metadata to persist even if not readable by itself (See the potential?). And Each Webform can be also quite smart!\n- The Strawberry field Field Widget will take all your Webform input, process any uploaded files, generate a JSON representation, enrich and complement it with Archipelago specific data and save it for you inside the `Strawberry field`.\n\nWe will come back to this later.\n")),(0,o.kt)("h3",{id:"linked-data"},"Linked Data"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"As the name of this step suggests; you will be adding all your Linked Data elements here.
