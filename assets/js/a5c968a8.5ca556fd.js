But to be honest (as someone that has been walking the main road laid in front here, filling up a hole here and there, but mostly visiting the side tracks and invisible paths between the bushes while doing so) it was never about the path; I say this in the deeper sense of two dots that connect. It was always (or became) about the slowly, patiently contemplated displacement. It is now and then about the surroundings, the changing seasons, the evolving and devolving of the landscape and mostly about the people (you, them) that we met, the shared times, the learning, narratives and tales and space while laying new reasons to advance and finding old reasons to stay behind.

A platform upon which to set down, brick by brick, your needs and ideas that  support your uses, that represent your core daily work efforts, a space to keep and share histories (your objects), ways, workflows, relationships that are the real gold (the yellow flowers in this meadow), your efforts and evolving needs and wishes.

And it is a happy place. We are privileged and proud (and lucky) that we have not left anyone behind and that we could stay true to our initial ideas. We have made more tools/tooling and the existing ones more colorful (fast too) and reliable. We have created things that you would not find somewhere else, not just because we can, but because we think you might need those. We have put reflections, self-critic, external criticism, deep care for details, time, efforts, inline comments, hundreds of slack messages and strong cups of coffee and tea into this software; and open minds and hearts into the act of community nurturing. We ensured that all what you have/had/knew is still valid - and in a huge effort for being (finally!) super concrete here - without introducing any deprecation or changes that could affect your precious (meta)data, the fruit of your efforts. All this means anything ingested on day one (Sep 18, 2018, when nobody even knew we were even planning this) is as valid, as immutable and as plastic, portable and yours as ever and will keep being so. Also worth mentioning, Archipelagos are running in the wild (never to be domesticated) in nearly every continent, from humble to large, with simple petals and some with complex/compound blooms, using pre conceived use cases and data models or unexpected ones.
